# Introduction to Classification

## Existing techniques

**What is Classification?**

1. Given a collection of records (training set)
   - Each record contains a set of attributes, one of the attributes is the class.
2. Find a model for class attributes as a function of the value of other functions
3. Goal: **previously unseen** records should be assigned a class as accurately as possible
   - A test set is used to determine the security of the model.

Example: Illustrating classification test

- Training set
- Test set
- Learning algorithm

- First learn a model, so we take the training set, giver it to learning algorithm and learn the model -> called induction.
- Training is called induction, testing is deduction

**Examples of classification**

- Predicting tumor cells as benigh or malignant
  - i.e. Classify MRI images
- classifying credit card transactions as legitmate or fraudulent
  - Banks don't use sophiscated algorithm at the moment, just detect unusual spending.
  - But algorithms can be added to test legitimacy of transaction.
- classifying of protein as alpha-helix, beta-sheet, or random coil
- Categorizing news stories as finance, weather, entertainment, sports, etc.

**Classification techniques**

1. Decision tree based methods
2. Rule-based methods
3. Memory based reasoning
4. Neural networks
5. Naive Bayes and Bayesian Belief networks
6. Support Vector Machines
