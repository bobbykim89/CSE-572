1. Select the correct statement about Reinforcement Learning.
- None of the above
  - Reinforcement learning is more general than supervised and unsupervised learning. It learns from interaction with environment to achieve a goal.

2. Select the correct statement about reinforcement learning as compared to the Markov Decision Process.
- It explores the environment
  - Reinforcement learning explores the environment to learn the transition and rewards.

3. For which problems will you need to use reinforcement learning?
- Navigating a robot through an unknown territory while avoiding obstructions.
  - Correct! Any application that required unsupervised environment exploration. Where examples are not available.

4. What are the actions in Reinforcement Learning (RL)?
- Stochastic or deterministic.  
  - Correct! It is generally stochastic but can also be deterministic. 

5. True or False? Markov Decision Process is a more challenging problem to solve compared to Reinforcement Learning.
- False
  - Correct! In Reinforcement Learning we do not have a model of environment. 

6. What is an issue with additive rewards approach?
- Rewards can go to infinite value.
  - Correct! For counting tasks, reward can go to infinity.  

7. Which of the following statements are true about the difference between Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Reinforcement learning (RL)? (select all that apply)
- RL learns from interaction with environment while MDP has a model of environment. 
  - Correct! RL does not have knowledge of the environment while MDP has such knowledge. 
- RL does not necessarily have knowledge of transition matrix and rewards, but MDP always knows them.
  - Correct! RL might or might not know transition matrix and rewards, but MDP always knows them.
