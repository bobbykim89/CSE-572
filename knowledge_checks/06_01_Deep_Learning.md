# KNOWLEDGE CHECK

1. Which reasons have contributed to deep learning success in recent decade? (select all that apply)
- Increase in computation power
- Increase in amount of available data.

2. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a type of: 
- Belief Network 

3. True or False? A neural network can be used to extract knowledge for complex data.
- True
  - Correct! For very complex systems, where we get data from a lot more sensors than Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can handle, we can extract deep knowledge using neural networks such as autoencoders.

4. Select the reason for using deep learning in recommendation systems. 
- To overcome cold start problems
  - Deep learning helps us overcome the cold start problem of recommendation systems since there are large amount of data and deep learning is effective in such scenarios. 

5. Which deep learning systems are most suitable for sequential problems?
- Recurrent neural networks 

6. Why are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) mostly used for image classification systems? 
- Image processing techniques commonly use convolution operation, and therefore CNNs are effective in extracting features from images. 

7. What is the purpose of a hidden layer in a Restricted Boltzman machine in a recommendation system?
- It is the wild guess about the user preferences 
  - Correct! Hidden layer is a guess about user preferences based on user ratings for items.

8. Which deep learning system has self-loops in its architecture?
- Recurrent neural networks 

9. What is the cold start problem in a movie recommendation system? (select all that apply)
- When a new movie has arrived, we do not know to whom to recommend the movie.
- When a new user has arrived, we do not know which movies to recommend
  - Correct! Cold start is when you want to provide recommendations but do not have any prior knowledge about users or items.

10. In an Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBM), why do we do backpropagation learning on the reversed machine?
- To adjust weights for better user preference extraction based on items’ rating.
  - Correct! Input layer has the items’ rating and hidden layer makes a guess on user preferences. 

11. What are autoencoders used for?
- For reducing dimension of a data

12. Which problem led to utilizing non-linear neural networks in form of multi-layer perceptron?
- XOR problem 
  - Correct! Single perceptron has linear boundaries and can not solve non-linear problem of XOR. This gap resulted in utilizing multi-layer perceptron to resolve the issue.
