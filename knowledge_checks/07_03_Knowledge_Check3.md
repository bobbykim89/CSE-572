1. Which problem cannot be solved by Dynamic Programming based on reinforcement learning?
- Helicopter
  - To use the dynamic programming based reinforcement learning, the environment should be defined. However, for the helicopter, the environment would be sky. It is extremely difficult to define the sky as a finite space environment.

2. Select the correct statement about the Monte Carlo solution.
- Learn from sample episodes of simulated experience
  - Since Monte Carlo solution is learning from the sample episodes of simulated experience, it does not require the model environment, which is an alternative solution of dynamic programming based solution.

3. Select the correct statement about Temporal Difference Learning.
- It does not require the model of environment
- It learns from values of successors
- It works for continuous task
- It is usually faster than MC
- **All of the above**
  - It is combined ideas from Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming. Therefore, it has more advantages as compared to sole usage of Monte Carlo or Dynamic Programming.

4. Which among Dynamic Programming (DP), Monte Carlo (MC), and Temporal Difference Learning (TDL) requires a perfect model of the system?
- DP
  - DP needs to divide problems into subproblems and hence requires a perfect model.
